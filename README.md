My Process

1. Carefully analyzed the provided reference sections.

3. Maintained consistent typography, spacing, and layout based on a 12-column grid system.
4. Created mobile-responsive designs by stacking content vertically, optimizing padding, and maintaining clarity on small screens.
5. Exported both desktop and mobile versions as high-resolution PNGs.
6. Used Lucide icons to match visual consistency and clarity.
